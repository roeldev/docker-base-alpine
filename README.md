## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| PUID | | Highly recommended, see below for explanation.
| PGID | | Highly recommended, see below for explanation.
| DISPLAY_MOTD | true | Set to `true` to display system info at container startup.
| VERBOSE_INIT | false | Set to `true` to verbose execute init commands. Helpful to see what's happening during container startup.


## User and group identifiers
When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. This issue is avoided by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will be resolved.

To find yours use `id user` as below. This will result in `PUID=1000` and `PGID=100`.

```
  $ id user
    uid=1000(user) gid=100(group) groups=100(group)
```
